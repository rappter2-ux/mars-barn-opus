"""Mars Barn Opus — Procedural Crew Journals

Each crew member writes a daily journal entry generated from their
current state. No scripted content — every entry is emergent from
sim data: health, morale, role, events, relationships, environment.

The journal IS the crew member's inner life. It's what makes
Chen W. feel like a person instead of a health bar.
